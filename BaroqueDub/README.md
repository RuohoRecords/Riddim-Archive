MIDI REGGAE RIDDIMS

released as part of the baroquedub digital 7-inch series
[http://baroquedub.co.uk/release_001.php]


Included is a midi file, an mp3 preview, the original audio sample and a filtered loop including tempo details.

Load into your favourite sequencer. Each instrument channel is mapped to a standard General Midi set - be creative in choosing your own sounds and patches and use new quantise and tempo settings to alter the feel. Each midi file is intended as a starting point for new and original music productions.

Contact info@baroquedub.co.uk if you feel your version is worth a listen and deserves exposure - as a netlabel we can arrange not-for-profit distribution. (links only, please, don't email any mp3 files!)
