### Pupa Vlados Original reggae-riddims.com + Camphouse Riddim Index

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Below is a downladable version of the original database of www.reggae-riddims.com, generously donated to the internet reggae community by the collecter of this info, Pupa Vlado. It contains +35 000 song titles, most of them with riddim info, +2300 albums, + 4000 artists.


Included in the same download is the latest version of Camphouse Riddim Index by Robert Camphouse, containing over 4000 tunes with riddim info.


#### Background

The Reggae-Riddims.com data was compiled by Pupa Vlado. Before his massive and truly pioneering work of collecting all this information and identifying riddims there were no such database available anywhere (although there where some work on paper, particularly around Studio One riddims).

Included in his database was material from other researchers, Robert Camphouse being one of them.

Vlado not only collected all this information and identified the riddims, he also made this riddim information freely available through his www.reggae-riddims.com site. The site soon became a focal point in the internet for people interested in reggae, partly because of the no-nonsense, straight to the point, non-commercial design of the site, but primarily for the incredible wealth of information it provided. The site was around for many years and hundreds of thousands visitors used it to find more version on their favourite riddims.

Early 2006 the www.reggae-riddims.com was still the best riddim database on the internet, despit the fact that Vlado hadn’t had time update it for a few years. Over the years this information has been, let us say... “copied”, into other riddim databases, but in 2006 reggae-riddims was still the by far best and most accurate riddim database around.

In 2006 the domain was lost. It soon re-appeared as a completely new site, with a new owner other content. This owner did own the domain, but not the data, which was still in Vlados database.

As a result of this, being the incredibly generous men they are, Vlado and (shortly after) and Robert Camphouse, decided to donate their riddim database to the Internet reggae community!

Which mean not only that the original data is available to you through this file, the data is also the foundation and/or an addition to most other riddim databases you see on the Internet.

#### Usage (important!)

You may use this data anyway you want under these conditions:

1. Credit Vlado and Robert Camphouse for his huge work of creating and donating this information. Many hours has gone into this!!!

2. Keep the “Source” information when updating the material or loading your database. Make a “Source” column in your DB tables. For future use it’s very practical if data from different sources are traced. Just for your own sake – it will save you a lot of time in eliminating copies if you later merge with another database which also has reggae-riddims as a source.
