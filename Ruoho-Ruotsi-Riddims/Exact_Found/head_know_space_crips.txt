Key:

- re-record Weedwacker textures at the right tempo ... modify the presets somewhat for a special sound
- play with the chord phrasing ...4 bars works better than 2
- set all melo-melo textures to dubstep loop, then bring in Numerology beat programming to finish this off!!!

- investigate the length of Ventola-texture, some really nice dub stabs in there!!!
- WHY don't keystrokes work for triggering things in ableton???????

Tempo: 70 bpm
